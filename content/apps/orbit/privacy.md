We take your privacy seriously. Orbit collects minimal anonymous data for the sole purpose of improving the app for its users. We never sell, rent or otherwise share user data. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

If you have opted-in to allow Apple to share information with developers, we receive some anonymous analytics.

In addition to Apple’s analytics, Octoscope uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous usage device and usage data along with limited error information. TelementryDeck’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy).

You may choose to share additional information with us, for example if submitting feedback or requesting support. If you do so, this information will be treated confidentially, used solely for the discussed purpose and will be deleted from our systems afterwards. This data will never be shared.
