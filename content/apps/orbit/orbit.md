Orbit is due to launch with iOS 18 in September 2024. If you're running an iOS Beta and would like to join the public beta, get in touch via Mastodon or email (see footer).

## The Orbit Philosphy

Mainstream task management apps encourage you to capture all actions, assign due dates and schedule workloads against planned personal capacity. This is great in a workplace, however I find intense GTD-style timeboxing is a poor fit for our personal lives where deep goals should fit flexibly around regular employment, school, health, family and/or everything else. Live is complicated and unpredictable, and I find it demoralising to see a list of menial chores with overdue dates against them.

Orbit is a tool for managing personal, non-urgent productivity. Orbit's core features revolve around **prioritisation** and **daily review**.

### Prioritisation

Order your tasks by priorty (whatever that means to you), and Orbit will help keep you focused on that item. Focus tasks are displayed prominently in-app and you can view & complete them quickly and easily anywhere on your iPhone - via Widgets, Controls and Live Activities. You can ask Siri about them, and access the data via Shortcuts.

Prioritisation features help you keep focused on what's most important to you, without getting distracted by menial chores.


### Daily Review

Once a day, Orbit asks you to review your active tasks and see what's still relevant. This adds helpful friction, preventing you from instinctively rolling over dozens of tasks into every single day.

By re-reading your active tasks on a daily basis, you're encouraged to keep your list focused and relvant.
