## Description

Orbit helps you plan your day and stay focused on what matters. Prioritise, review, and get things done without endless task lists. Orbit keeps you focused with a clear UI, deep system integrations, a daily review flow, and helpful friction.

## Key Features

- Capture tasks in all areas of your life, and use contexts to organise them at scale.
- Prioritise tasks and maintain focus using simple in-app tools.
- Track and complete your current tasks via Control Center, Live Activities, and Interactive Widgets.
- Add rich notes to tasks with Markdown support.
- Automate most things with Shortcuts.
- Access data with Siri and Spotlight using rich semantic search (Apple Intelligence).
- Customise your experience with icons and colours.
- Seamlessly sync data between all your devices using iCloud.

## Platform Support

Version 1.0 is designed for iPhone. I plan to add dedicated Watch, iPad, and visionOS support in future updates, provided there's customer interest.
