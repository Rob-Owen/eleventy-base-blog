## Description

Orbit is an upcoming iOS 18 app for planning your day. Prioritize, refine, and complete key tasks without the overhead of managing endless task lists. Orbit keeps you focused with a clear UI, deep system integrations, a daily review flow, and helpful friction.

Orbit is designed to stand out from GTD-inspired task management apps. Instead of bringing workplace-inspired project management into your personal life, Orbit encourages you to focus on what's important to you, checking in daily to keep yourself on track and tackling one thing at a time.

You can use Orbit as a standalone daily prioritization app or integrate it with your existing task management workflow. Orbit supports rich App Intents, Interactive Widgets, and new iOS 18 Controls. You can add anything you like, and organise tasks into Contexts for specific areas of you life, priortizing independently within each Context. Orbit supports arbitrary markdown notes.
