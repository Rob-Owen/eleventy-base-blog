We take your privacy seriously. HomeUI does not want your data, and collects only minimal anonymised app usage data for the sole purpose of improving the app for its users. We never sell, rent or otherwise share user data. In particular, HomeUI does not and will never collect any data about your home, network or accessories.

If you have opted-in to allow Apple to share information with developers, we receive some anonymous analytics.

In addition to Apple’s analytics, HomeUI uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous data. TelemetryDeck’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/).
