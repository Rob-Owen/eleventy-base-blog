## What if I have multiple meters?

Octoscope can display data for three meters at a time:
- One electricity meter
- One gas meter
- One export meter (Octoscope Pro)

If you have multiple meters in any category, head to Settings to choose between them. Octoscope can handle multiple accounts too. If you have multiple accounts, select one from Settings. You can change this at any time.

## Does Octoscope show solar data?

Yes. Octoscope has full support export data for Octoscope Pro users on v3.0 or higher.

## Can I view my electricity exports?

Yes. Octoscope has full support export data for Octoscope Pro users on v3.0 or higher.

## Does Octoscope support gas data?

Yes. Note that gas pricing and carbon emissions are estimates based on typical conversion factors, and gas prices may differ slightly from those shown on your bill.

## Does Octoscope support my tariff?

Yes, with a caveat.

Octoscope automatically identifies and retrieves pricing data for all current and historic tariffs. This includes fixed tariffs, as well as smart electricity tariffs (e.g. Octopus Go, Tracker and Agile).

Note that Octopus Energy don't publish historic Intelligent Go daytime charging slots. The app can only know about upcoming ones - these will show in your pricing but won't be found in older history.
