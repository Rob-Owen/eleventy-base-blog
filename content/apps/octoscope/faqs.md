## What if I have multiple meters?

Octoscope displays data for one electricity meter at a time. If you have multiple meters, head to Settings to choose between them. Octoscope can handle multiple accounts too. If you have multiple accounts, select one from Settings. You can change this at any time.

## Can I view my electricity exports?

To view export data, switch to an export meter via Settings -> Smart Meters. Consumption data shown across the app will then reflect your export  meter and tariff. Octoscope's UI is geared towards import meters, and pricing and carbon calculations may not be relevant for export data. A future update will add additional support for export data. 

## Does Octoscope support gas data?

Yes. Octoscope v2.0 added gas data on top of electricity functionality. You can configure which fuels to include in Settings. Note that gas pricing and carbon emissions are estimates based on typical conversion factors, and gas prices may differ slightly from those shown on your bill.

## Can I export data?

Yes. 

Octoscope allows users to export half-hourly and daily data in CSV format via the Share Sheet. Power-users can automate data exports via Apple Shortcuts.

## Does Octoscope support my tariff?

Yes, with a caveat.

Octoscope automatically identifies and retrieves pricing data for all current and historic tariffs. This includes fixed tariffs, as well as smart electricity tariffs (e.g. Octopus Go, Tracker and Agile).

Octoscope does not currently support dynamically allocated off-peak or free periods. This includes Intelligent Octopus additional off-peak slots beyond 11:30-5:30, and Octopus Power-Up free slots. This means in-app pricing estimates may be slightly higher than your actual bills.
