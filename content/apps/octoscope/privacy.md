We take your privacy seriously. Octoscope collects minimal anonymous data for the sole purpose of improving the app for its users. We never sell, rent or otherwise share user data. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

Octoscope handles sensitive data about your Octopus account. Octopus API tokens are stored securely on your Apple Keychain (on-device, or in iCloud) and are never shared outside the app. Electricity consumption data and pricing is also stored on-device and is not visible to us. We collect some anonymised data on your tariff(s) and basic account configuration details.

If you have opted-in to allow Apple to share information with developers, we receive some anonymous analytics.

In addition to Apple’s analytics, Octoscope uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous data. TelementryDeck’s privacy policy can be found here. Octoscope uses the RevenueCat SDK which captures some analytics related to in-app purchases and subscriptions. You can find RevenueCat’s privacy policy here.

You may choose to share additional information with us, for example if submitting feedback or requesting support. If you do so, this information will be treated confidentially, used solely for the discussed purpose and will be deleted from our systems afterwards. This data will never be shared, except with your explicit consent.
