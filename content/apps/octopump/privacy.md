We take your privacy seriously. OctoPump collects minimal anonymous data for the sole purpose of improving the app for its users. We never sell, rent or otherwise share user data. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

OctoPump handles sensitive data about your Octopus Energy account. Octopus API tokens are stored securely on your iCloud Keychain and are never shared outside with the developer. API keys are solely used to monitor and control your heating system to deliver app functionality.

If you have opted-in to allow Apple to share information with developers, we receive some anonymous analytics.

In addition to Apple’s analytics, OctoPump uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous data. TelementryDeck’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/).
