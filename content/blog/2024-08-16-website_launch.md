Welcome to the new website. I'll be using this site to host App-related content as well as personal blog posts and news updates. This post covers some of the tech I've gone with. Read on if interested!

## The Technology

For me, a static website beats a web server architecture for this sort of thing every time - better scalability, lower latency, far lower running costs, few security concerns, the list goes on. I can write markdown and turn that into content with no WYSIWYG interface to learn.

This site is built on eleventy (11ty - see [here](https://www.11ty.dev)), a 'simple' static site generator built in javascript. Any static site generator would have been suitable, so don't take this as a technology recommendation.

My experience of 11ty so far has been good. I've built on top of the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) which has help me bootstrap a working setup without re-inventing the wheel. The builds are fast and I can write in markdown syntax on my local machine.

## Why change?

First, a bit of history. When setting out as indepedent app developer in 2022, I had a lot to learn: iOS development, Swift, SwiftUI & numerous other Apple SDKs. Design skills and marketing were also new to me. I knew that every app needed a supporting infrastructure, a product pitch, marketing, website and some way of manning the support inbox.

I knew web could be a distraction. I've professional experience in this area and have seen various web projects start-to-finish. It risked become a comfortable distraction from the hard new stuff.

An attractive developer-friendly website was a risk in the early days, so I started with wordpress - a platform I'm deeply unhappy to use. This was a good thing for my app development. I'm not saying wordpress is _bad_, but it's a poor fit for someone experienced in static websites, CI/CD, code-driven config and version controlled updates.

_Now_ things have moved forward. I am about to launch my third indie app and want to simplify and consolidate the websites that support the core app business, so I can spend less time & money on the websites while gaining more control and flexibility to do what I need. Out with wordpress.

I'll be updating the website content, design & technical features over time.
