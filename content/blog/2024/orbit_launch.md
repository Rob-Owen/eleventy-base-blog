## Orbit Launches Today

Orbit is now available!

I'm excited to enter the productivity app space with a novel and opinionated take on to-do lists. Orbit is designed to meet the needs of users who want a clearer sense of priority from their task manager, and enjoy the helpful friction of a daily review.

Orbit goes live with day one support for new iOS 18 features, including control center integration and light, dark and tinted icons. I've been thinking about this project for years, and working on the tech since mid 2023.

You can read more on the [Orbit page](/_site/apps/orbit/index.html), or head over to the App Store:
